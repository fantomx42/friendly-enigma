# Symbolic Collapse Model - Core Axioms

1. Meaning is what survives symbolic pressure.
2. Meaning is the remainder after compression.
3. If a symbol collapses under pressure, it never had real meaning.
4. Meaning is not assigned. It's demonstrated.
5. SCM doesn't measure meaning directly - it measures the conditions under which meaning can exist.
6. Stories don't create meaning. Stability does.
7. Meaning is the ability of a symbol to remain usable after context loss.
8. If it only works when explained, it isn't meaningful.
