# Future Work

- ~~**GPU acceleration** — HIP kernels for parallel chunk evolution on AMD GPUs (ROCm)~~ ✅ [Done](gpu.md)
- **Embedding-based routing** — semantic similarity for chunk selection instead of keywords
- **Reconstructive recall** — memories influenced by current context (Darman architecture)
