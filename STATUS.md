# CURRENT PROJECT STATE
- **Phase:** Phase III: Capability Expansion
- **Active Goal:** Enhancing Memory Systems (Vector DB + Experimental Wheeler Spatial Memory).
- **Secondary Goal:** BitNet (1-bit LLM) research and inference optimization for local hardware.

# RECENT UPDATES
...
# BLOCKERS
- Memory is limited to `RALPH_PROGRESS.md` (needs structured JSON/Vector store).
- Conductor track management needs consistent synchronization with project status.
- UI: Real-time telemetry for NPU/GPU usage is missing from GUI.

# COMPLETED MILESTONES
- Native GUI Dashboard with real-time swarm visualization
- REM Sleep autonomous memory consolidation
- Tool Registry with security checkpoint integration
- Forklift Protocol for intelligent memory loading
- Security Checkpoint (towers, dogs, guards)
- Message Bus with circuit breakers and priority routing
