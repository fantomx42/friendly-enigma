# CURRENT PROJECT STATE
- **Phase:** Phase III: Capability Expansion
- **Active Goal:** Implementing Long-Term Memory (Context) and Tool Registry (Action).

# RECENT UPDATES
- [2026-01-12] **Refactoring Complete:** Core logic moved to `ralph_core/`. Root directory cleaned.
- [2026-01-12] **100% Local FOSS Swarm** online (DeepSeek/Qwen/Mistral).
- [2026-01-12] Autonomous Loop (`ralph_loop.sh`) validated.

# BLOCKERS
- Ralph can write code but cannot *execute* it automatically (needs Tool Registry).
- Memory is limited to `RALPH_PROGRESS.md` (needs structured JSON/Vector store).
