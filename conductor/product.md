# Initial Concept
Ralph AI is a local-first, FOSS 3-tier hierarchical swarm system for autonomous task execution.

# Ralph AI: Product Definition

## Initial Concept
Ralph AI is a hierarchical local swarm system designed for autonomous task execution. It utilizes the "Ralph Wiggum Method" of iterative failure and refinement to achieve success without cloud dependencies or token costs.

## Product Vision
To provide a 100% private, hardware-optimized autonomous agent system that moves beyond simple text-based retrieval by integrating a custom "Wheeler" spatial memory architecture for human-like associative recall.

## Target Audience
- **Local-First Developers:** Individuals who require a private coding assistant that runs entirely on their own silicon.
- **Enterprise Automation Teams:** Organizations looking to deploy specialized agent swarms for internal workflows without data leakage.
- **AI Researchers:** Professionals exploring the intersection of hierarchical LLM orchestration and dynamical system-based memory.

## Core Value Proposition
- **Privacy & Autonomy:** Zero-cost, zero-latency (local), and zero-leakage execution.
- **Wheeler Memory Dynamics:** A revolutionary associative memory system based on spatial attractors, providing deeper context than standard RAG.
- **Silicon-Aware Performance:** Native optimization for high-end consumer hardware (AMD RDNA4/RX 9070 XT) via automated configuration.

## Key Features (Priority Order)
1. **The Wheeler Bridge:** Deep integration of spatial/attractor dynamics into the agent's cognition.
2. **The Ralph Loop:** A persistent, self-correcting development loop (Analyze -> Execute -> Verify).
3. **Hardware-Aware Boot:** Automated detection and tuning of GPU, VRAM, and CPU resources on initialization.
4. **Dynamic Tool Forging:** The "Machinist" agent capable of metaprogramming new utilities on demand.

## User Experience: The Neural Dashboard
The primary interface is a web-based "Neural Dashboard" that provides:
- Real-time visualization of memory attractors and basins of attraction.
- A live swarm traffic map showing communication between Translator, Orchestrator, and ASIC agents.
- VRAM/RAM heatmaps and hardware performance metrics.

## Strategic Roadmap (3-Month North Star)
- **Memory Perfection:** Transition from experimental to production-ready Wheeler Memory, allowing the agent to perform associative recall across long-term task histories using purely spatial dynamics.
