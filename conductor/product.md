# Initial Concept\nRalph AI is a local-first, FOSS 3-tier hierarchical swarm system for autonomous task execution.
\n# Product Definition\n\n## Target Audience\n- **Sovereign Developers**: Individual developers who want the power of autonomous agent swarms without the constraints, costs, or privacy implications of corporate LLM APIs.\n- **Privacy-Conscious Engineers**: Professionals working on sensitive codebases that require local execution for security compliance.\n- **System Architecture Enthusiasts**: Users interested in exploring hierarchical multi-agent dynamics and local model orchestration.\n\n## Key Differentiators\n- **Local-First & FOSS**: Designed specifically to run on high-end consumer hardware (GPU/NPU) using open-source models (DeepSeek, Qwen, Mistral).\n- **Iterative Resilience (The Wiggum Protocol)**: A unique operational loop that treats errors as diagnostic signals, allowing the system to self-correct and iterate until a success condition is met.\n- **Hierarchical ASIC Swarm**: Instead of relying on a single large model, Ralph employs a "Librarian" for memory, an "Orchestrator" for strategy, and tiny "ASIC" specialists for micro-tasks, optimizing both performance and VRAM usage.\n- **Hybrid Memory System**: Combines vector-based semantic search with experimental spatial dynamics (Wheeler Memory) to maintain long-term context and project-wide awareness.\n\n## Interaction Model\n- **Native GUI Dashboard**: A high-performance Rust-based native interface for real-time visualization of agent traffic, VRAM utilization, and swarm health.\n- **CLI-First Loop**: A robust command-line interface for direct task execution and integration into existing developer workflows.\n- **Multimodal Extension**: Support for voice input and vision analysis to allow for more natural and complex task descriptions.
