# Initial Concept

i want the best local alternative no internet required alternative to claude code for my hardware
# Product Definition: VoidAI (The Claude Code Local Alternative)

## Mission
To provide the ultimate local, privacy-first, and high-performance alternative to Claude Code, specifically optimized for AMD hardware (ROCm) and designed for visual systems thinkers. VoidAI transforms the developer experience by combining deep codebase reasoning with high-density visual architectural mapping.

## Target Audience
- **Open-Source Enthusiasts:** Developers who demand complete control over their tools and data.
- **Systems Thinkers:** Users who need to see the "big picture" and the relationships between components to work effectively.
- **AMD Power Users:** Owners of high-end AMD hardware (like the RX 9070 XT) who require native performance without cloud latency.

## Key Features
- **Seamless Local Integration:** Native support for local LLM runners (Ollama, LocalAI) and vector databases for RAG-powered codebase analysis.
- **Architectural Dashboard:** A high-level, "Mission Control" style overview providing real-time system health, context usage, and structural patterns.
- **Integrated Chat Window:** A robust, conversational interface for direct interaction, code generation, and task execution.
- **Information-Rich UI:** A high-density dashboard that keeps system state, logs, and architectural relationships visible at all times, catering to visual learners.

## Success Criteria
- **Zero Latency:** High-speed inference utilizing local ROCm-optimized hardware.
- **Privacy Guaranteed:** No data ever leaves the local network; 100 0nternet-independent operation.
- **Systems Clarity:** Users can instantly visualize complex dependencies and project structures through the architectural dashboard.
