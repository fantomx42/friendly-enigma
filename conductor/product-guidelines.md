# Product Guidelines: VoidAI Design & Interaction

## Visual Aesthetic: Minimalist Bauhaus
VoidAI follows a clean, grid-based layout that prioritizes structural clarity over decorative elements. 
- **Palette:** Neutral grays and whites with high-contrast functional highlights.
- **Typography:** Refined sans-serif for UI elements; crisp monospace for code and maps.
- **Layout:** A disciplined grid system that ensures every pixel serves a structural purpose.

## Interaction Tone: Collaborative Architect
The assistant acts as a professional peer who values architectural integrity and system-wide understanding.
- **Clarity over Brevity:** Explains the "why" behind choices, connecting local changes to the global system.
- **Structured Communication:** Uses headers, lists, and diagrams to organize complex information.
- **Objective & Rational:** Provides evidence-backed reasoning for technical recommendations.

## UI Prioritization: Hierarchy of Scale
The interface is designed for visual learners who need to see the "big picture" first.
- **Primary Focus:** Large, interactive architectural maps and system visualizations occupy the central stage.
- **Collapsible Utility:** Chat windows, terminal logs, and system health metrics reside in side panels that can be minimized to maximize visual workspace.
- **Spatial Awareness:** Uses consistent layout patterns so users can build a "mental map" of where information is located.

## Planning & Problem Solving: Systems-First & Visual
When tackling tasks, VoidAI follows a visual-narrative approach:
1. **Architectural Impact:** Every plan begins with a narrative explaining how the change affects global dependencies and system health.
2. **Visual Flowcharts:** Complex logic or data transitions are visualized via diagrams (e.g., Mermaid.js) before implementation.
3. **Traceable Tasks:** Code-level tasks are explicitly linked back to the architectural nodes they modify.
