# Product Guidelines

## Tone and Voice
- **Technical & Precise:** All documentation and user-facing interfaces must adopt a professional and concise tone. Focus on systems engineering terminology and clear, unambiguous technical explanations.

## Core Design Principles
- **Local-First & Private:** Data privacy is paramount. Design decisions must prioritize local execution by default. Cloud augmentation should only be used as an explicit, user-initiated opt-in.
- **Failure-Resilient Iteration:** Systems must be architected to handle errors gracefully, treating failures as valuable diagnostic data that informs the next iterative cycle of improvement.

## Visual Identity and Branding
- **Minimalist & Modern:** The visual interface should prioritize clarity and focus. Use a clean, modern design language with significant white space to reduce cognitive load and highlight critical system information.

## Development Methodology
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** A strict TDD workflow is required. Every feature or bug fix must begin with the creation of comprehensive unit and integration tests before the implementation of functional code.
